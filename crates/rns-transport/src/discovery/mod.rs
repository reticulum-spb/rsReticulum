//! On-network interface discovery — Rust port of Python `RNS/Discovery.py`.
//!
//! The announcer periodically posts PoW-stamped discovery announces on
//! `rnstransport.discovery.interface`. The receiver validates stamps, stores
//! learned interfaces, and (optionally) auto-connects to eligible transport
//! nodes. A separate blackhole updater fetches blackhole manifests from
//! configured sources via link request.
//!
//! # Stamper indirection
//!
//! Python imports `LXMF.LXStamper` at startup. rsReticulum avoids an upward
//! dependency on rsLXMF, so discovery takes a [`DiscoveryStamper`] trait object;
//! the runtime supplies a native default, and embedding apps can override it.
