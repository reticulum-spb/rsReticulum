---

rsReticulum is a Rust implementation of Reticulum. This is not a fork of
Reticulum; it is Reticulum written in a different language, focused on staying
interoperable. It is not the source-of-truth implementation, do not treat it as one.

Commands are intentionally namespaced for Rust with `*-rs` command names, so
rsReticulum can live beside other Reticulum tools on `PATH` without worry.

## Build It

### macOS

Install Rust with `rustup`, then install Apple's command-line build tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Build the tools:

```bash
cd rsReticulum
cargo build --release
```

### Linux, Raspberry Pi, and VPS Hosts

##### Install Rust with `rustup`, then install the needed packages:

Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc make pkgconf-pkg-config
```

Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel pkgconf
```

##### Build the tools:

```bash
cd rsReticulum
cargo build --release
```

### Windows

Install Rust with the MSVC toolchain. If Rust or Cargo asks for Visual Studio
Build Tools, install the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

Build from PowerShell:

```powershell
cd rsReticulum
cargo build --release
```

After the build, use the commands below with `./target/release/<tool>` on
macOS/Linux or `.\target\release\<tool>.exe` on Windows.

## Tool Usage

The `rns-tools` crate builds Rust-namespaced Reticulum utilities:

| Binary | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| rnsd-rs | Shared Reticulum daemon. Owns interfaces and local control sockets. |
| rnstatus-rs | Interface, announce, path, link, and aggregate status. |
| rnpath-rs | Path lookup, path table inspection, rates, drops, and blackhole actions. |
| rnid-rs | Identity generation, inspection, public/private import/export, hashing, signing, verification, encryption, and decryption. |
| rnprobe-rs | Destination probe utility with loss and round-trip reporting. |
| rncp-rs | File transfer utility with send, listen, and authenticated fetch modes. |
| rnodeconf-rs | RNode inspection, safe configuration, EEPROM backup, and trust utility. |
| rnsh-rs | Reticulum shell listener/client. |

#### Commands:

rnsh-rs     [-i FILE] [-s NAME] [-N] [-m] [-w SECONDS] <destination_hash> [-- CMD...]
```

Add the release `bin/` directory or `target/release` to `PATH` if
you want to call them without a path prefix.

`rncp-rs` follows the established listener authentication model: without `-n`,
incoming senders must match `-a <hash>` or an `allowed_identities` file.
`rncp-rs -F` can serve fetch requests to authenticated clients; use
`-j <jail>` to bound file access unless unrestricted fetch paths are
intentional.

`rnodeconf-rs` in the current build only covers safe inspection/device setting paths, EEPROM
dump/backup, and trusted-key storage.

`rnid-rs` tracks the Reticulum 1.2.5 identity utility surface for normal
software identities: public/private import and export, destination hashing,
`.pub` public identity files, and signed `.rsg` signature files. The
hardware-backed `rnid-rs hw` path is a Rust extension behind the `hardware`
feature and should still be treated as experimental.

Common `rnid-rs` flows:

```bash
# Generate and inspect an identity.
rnid-rs -g ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -p
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -H lxmf.delivery

# Export text identity material. -x is public, -X is private.
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -x -b
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -X -B

# Write identity files. Without -X, -w writes a public .pub file.
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -w mgmt.pub
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -X -w mgmt.rid
rnid-rs -m <public_identity_data> -w peer.pub
rnid-rs -M <private_identity_data> -X -w restored_identity

# Sign and validate. New signatures are Reticulum 1.2.5 .rsg envelopes.
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -s message.txt
rnid-rs -V message.txt.rsg
rnid-rs -i <signer_hash> -N -V message.txt.rsg

# Encrypt to a public identity, decrypt with the matching private identity.
rnid-rs -i mgmt.pub -e message.txt
rnid-rs -i ~/.rsReticulum/identities/mgmt -d message.txt.rfe
```

Use `--raw -s <file>` only when a workflow intentionally needs the legacy raw
64-byte signature form. Normal `rnid-rs -s <file>` produces a `.rsg` file that
embeds the signer metadata needed for 1.2.5 validation.

## Configuration

`rnsd-rs` reads Reticulum INI config from `<config-dir>/config`. If no config
directory is supplied, the default is:

| Platform | Default config file |
| --- | --- |
| Linux/macOS | `/etc/rsReticulum/config`, then `~/.config/rsReticulum/config`, then `~/.rsReticulum/config` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\rsReticulum\config` |

Generate the annotated starter file:

```bash
rnsd-rs --exampleconfig
```

Minimal TCP client example:

```ini
[reticulum]
share_instance = yes
instance_control_socket = yes
enable_transport = no

[interfaces]

  [[Default TCP]]
    type = TCPClientInterface
    enabled = yes
    target_host = rns.ratspeak.org
    target_port = 4242
```

Existing Python Reticulum configs should work if every requested interface
is implemented here. Unknown or not-yet-wired interfaces should be removed or
disabled until support lands.

The default shared-instance data/control ports are `37428`/`37429`. Ratspeak
uses app-private `37430`/`37431` ports. If you run two daemons at the same
time, give one config a distinct port pair to avoid confliction, like:

```ini
[reticulum]
shared_instance_port = 37432
instance_control_port = 37433
```

## Interface Support

###### Note: This is alpha, if something doesn't work, open an issue with enough context/information to help contribute to fixing it.

| Interface | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| TCP client/server | Config-backed IPv4 and IPv6 paths. |
| UDP | Config-backed unicast and multicast paths. |
| Auto | Config-backed UDP discovery plus TCP fallback. |
| Local shared instance | Config-backed TCP loopback or Unix socket depending on platform. |
| I2P | Config-backed SAM v3.1 path. |
| Pipe | Config-backed subprocess stdio pipe. |
| Backbone | Config-backed high-latency WAN-style tunnel. |
| Serial, KISS, RNode, RNode Multi, AX.25 KISS | Config-backed with the `serial` feature. |
| BLE RNode | Config-backed with the `ble` feature. |
| Bluetooth Peer | Runtime API used by Ratspeak. |
| Android USB-OTG | Runtime API for Android app embeddings. |
| Weave | Not implemented. |
| Bluetooth Classic RFCOMM | Not implemented. |

## Compatibility Notes

Most daemon and utility flows are implemented for the public `*-rs` tools:
`rnsd-rs`, `rnstatus-rs`, `rnpath-rs`, `rnid-rs`, `rnprobe-rs`, `rncp-rs`,
`rnsh-rs`, and `rnodeconf-rs`.

The current compatibility target is Reticulum 1.2.5 where the matching Rust
surface is implemented and tested. `rnid-rs` has explicit 1.2.5 coverage for
the normal identity utility flow.

Known gaps and intentional limits:

- `rnx`, `rnir`, `rnpkg`, `rngit`, and `git-remote-rns` are not implemented. There is on-going work in progress for supporting these.
- `rnodeconf-rs` is partial; safe inspection/configuration and EEPROM
  dump/backup are furthest along. Firmware flashing, autoinstall/update, ROM
  bootstrap, destructive EEPROM wipe, and full signing-key management are not
  implemented.
- `rnstatus-rs` covers the practical operator surface, but does not implement
  every display/API behavior from upstream.
- `rnpath-rs` remote mode is read-only for table/rates, including destination
  filters, apart from the remote blackhole-list query path. Remote mutations
  and remote active path requests are full gaps.
- `rncp-rs` implements the listener `-b` announce interval. `-P/--phy-rates`
  is not supported for the time being.
- `rns-ratkey` hardware identity support is feature-gated and still has known
  hardware-verification gaps before it should be described as release-ready.

## Contributing

If the issue or contribution belongs upstream as well, start there. Python LXMF
and Reticulum remain the reference implementations.

PRs are closed for now until I have time to catch up on everything. I'm tired.
